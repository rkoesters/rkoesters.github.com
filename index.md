Welcome
=======

Welcome to my personal web page. This site was programmed with HTML5 in
mind, and, as it is a personal website, I put very little effort into
ensuring compatibility with older browsers. If you have not already, I
suggest getting [Frefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) or 
[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) (or 
[Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/Home)).

Site under construction
-----------------------

The about page and the blog are still under construction, so be patient.
But don't expect them to ever be complete, that's just asking too much.
