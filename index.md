Welcome to my personal web page. This site was programmed with HTML5 in
mind, and, as it is a personal website, I put very little effort into
ensuring compatablty with older browsers. If you have not already, I
suggest getting <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">
Firefox</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome"> Chrome</a>
(or <a href="http://www.chromium.org/Home">Chromium</a>).

### Site under construction

The about page and the blog are still under construction, so be patient.
But don't expect them to ever be complete, that's just asking too much.
