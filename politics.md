title: Politics

I hate that people pick sides.  Political parties are like 2 companies
that both want you to buy their product (vote for them).  We know from
capitalism that competition causes both sides to compete with each other
and in turn both companies create better products (platforms).  I
***want*** a strong Republican party.  I ***want*** a strong Democratic
party.  I ***want*** the choice between the two options.  Anyone that
sees politics as an identity instead of a choice is robbing themselves
of the benefits of democracy.
