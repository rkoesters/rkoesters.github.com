So here is my very first blog post. It will probably be very short and
simple. I think the best way to go about doing a blog is treating it
kinda like a journal, so I will give that a try. I guess I will talk
about college a little bit.

I am at University of Wisconsin - Madison and I am gonna be studying
Computer Science. So far, this school is freaking awesome, there are
great parties and great people.

I am finding the independence thing a double edged sword. Independence
is awesome, but so difficult, and my ADD doesn't make it any easier. I
think I have found that the worst distractions for me are ones related
to programming. Time just files by. I think I struggle with being able
to choose something that will make me feel better in the long run
(getting work done so I can hang out with friends) over something that
will make me feel a little better in the short run (farting around on
my computer). Speaking of which, imma go get some work done.
